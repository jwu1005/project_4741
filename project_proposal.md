Proposal: Predicting 2019 MLB Postseason

By: Jiacheng Wu (jw2545) and Brian Won (bw436)


We propose that for our project, we predict how the upcoming MLB postseason will play out. This is an important endeavor worth pursuing given that across most team sports, it's much harder to predict the playoffs than the regular season. The glaring difference is that teams play differently between the two, with baseball as Exhibit A.

Thanks to off days during the playoff schedule, teams usually rely on 3-man starting rotations and their better relievers because they can get their rest between games. Just the playoff atmosphere itself may influence players to play differently. We can look into why just regular season stats aren't enough to confidently predict the postseason. If we can identify attributes that are more predictive (and why), we can use them to make our own predictions.

Thankfully, there are tons of baseball data reflecting so many facets of the game from well-maintained sources such as Fangraphs, Baseball Reference, and the MLB website. At this point, we need to figure out how we will carry out the predictions; as in, to what granularity? We're most likely going to predict at a game-by-game basis. Regardless of the approach, we're going to need a lot of player data that we can use to assess their skill and historic trends.
