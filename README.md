About: In the spirit of the upcoming baseball postseason, we are going to take a swing at predicting how it's going to play out. Across team sports in general, the playoffs are much harder to predict than the regular season. Firstly, there are much less games played during the playoffs. Secondly, teams actually employ different tactics during the playoffs, when the stakes are much greater. For this project, we hope to gain any insights on "difference in play" between the regular season and playoffs. Using what we find, we will predict this year's postseason.
